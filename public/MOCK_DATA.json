        "brief_intro": "A deep dive into how microservices can improve scalability and maintainability in large web applications.",
        "details": "Microservices architecture is a design approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services. Each service runs its own process and communicates via lightweight mechanisms such as HTTP or messaging queues. This approach enables faster development cycles, better scalability, fault isolation, and easier deployment compared to monolithic architectures.",
